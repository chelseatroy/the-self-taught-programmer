# Getting Started: The Autodidact's Notebook

I have a secret laboratory. I carry it with me everywhere.

Progress tracking system: a notebook

get better AT getting better at \(solving a second order problem\)

Choose a curriculum with a deliverable, and only get one degree removed from it

example: ml curriculum to help you make x. study y library to help you use ml to make x. Don't study whatever you need to customize y library. Don't study the math of y. You need something you can track progress and win at without going down a rabbit hole, and you need to learn how to learn JUST ENOUGH for your use case. Why? Because this is how knowledge works in the real world. Rather than be an expert in one thing, you are best off having CONTEXT on a broad set of skills, with the ability to delve into any one of those skills at any time. This is a way to avoid hammer-nail syndrome and end up using the wrong solution for a problem just because you didn't know a better one exists.

That said, you can make a note of things you want to come BACK to. With more context on why you need to know this thing, you will have more motivation to learn it, too

one step further: learning is about being able to produce answers and apply ideas, not just read or memorize them. So take exercises one step further rather than just copying them, to solve problems on your own. Example: implement gradient descent for multiple feature dimensions instead of just one, or come up w new ways to visualize data instead of just graphing it. 

### Benefits of a Notebook:

1. Writing in it forces you to think \(thinking fast and slow\)
2. Having a record helps you look back at your progress
3. Helps to codify focused practice \(Grit\)
4. Gives you the freedom to draw pictures and associate \(Moonwalking with Einstein\)
