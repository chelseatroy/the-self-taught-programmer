# Setting Goals and Expectations

You may already have a goal in mind that prompted you to open this book. Or maybe you only know that you want to improve your skills, and you're looking for more guidance on how to set goals. 

The idea of goals comes with some pitfalls for a self-taught programmer. The first is the idea of "doneness"â€”when we accomplish a goal, we consider ourselves done with something. In programming, here is always more to learn, and the technology is always changing. So a goal like "learn Ruby" might be too broad, since it could be difficult to establish a finish line.
