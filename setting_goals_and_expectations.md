# Setting Goals and Expectations

You may already have a goal in mind that prompted you to open this book. Or maybe you only know that you want to improve your skills, and you're looking for more guidance on how to set goals. 

The idea of goals comes with some pitfalls for a self-taught programmer. The first is the idea of "doneness"â€”when we accomplish a goal, we consider ourselves done with something. In programming, here is always more to learn, and the technology is always changing. So a goal like "learn iOS" might be too broad, since it could be difficult to establish a finish line.

Instead, it can be helpful to establish a specific project in which to learn something new about programming. For example, you may have a specific iOS app in mind, and you would like to complete that app. A project offers gives you an established finish line and a way to move forward incrementally until you arrive.
